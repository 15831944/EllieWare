  <h1>Extending RobotWare</h1>

  RobotWare provides a wide variety of functions for general purpose use.  However, you may need
  additional functionality which is specific to your situation.  Luckily, RobotWare makes this easy
  by allowing you to write your own 'plugins' to extend RobotWare.<p>

  A plugin is a .NET dynamic link library (DLL) which implements specific interfaces so that RobotWare
  can integrate your plugin into the RobotWare product.  Your plugin is then seamlessly
  integrated into RobotWare and appears alongside all the standard RobotWare functions.
  Integration allows your plugin to save and load any setting information to a RobotWare
  specification.<p>
