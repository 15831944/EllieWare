  <h1>Debugging</h1>

  Most times, a RobotWare specification will run without problems.  Occasionally,
  things will not work as expected.<p>

  To diagnose where your specification is going wrong, there are the following features:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Single step in the Editor</b></li><br>
    Allows you to execute the specification one step at a time.  You should then see which
    step fails.  This is the recommended method for debugging a specification.
    <li><b>Debug statements</b></li><br>
    Record information to the log window.  These can be put in a specification at various
    places to monitor progress.  This feature is available as a builtin RobotWare feature
    under the <i>Debugging</i> category.
  </ul>
