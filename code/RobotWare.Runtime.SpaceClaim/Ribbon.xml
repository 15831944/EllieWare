          For the 'tab' and 'group' elements, you can either specify a 'label' attribute, or you can
          specify a 'command' attribute.  The 'command' attribute gives the name of a command that you
          create, whose Text property will be used for the label.  This approach allows for localization
          since you can use a string resource.  For illustration, this first 'group' uses a 'command' 
          attribute, and the remaining 'group' elements use a 'label' attribute.  If you specify both
          attributes, the 'label' attribute is overridden by the 'command' attribute.

            Command names match the names of Command objects created by the add-in in its 
            ICommandExtensibility.Initialize method, or the names of built-in commands. Command names
            need to be unique, and are typically of the form, "MyAddIn.MyCommandName".  Since there
            are several sample add-ins for different languages and different versions of the API, and
            since more than one of these sample add-ins might be enabled, these sample add-in commands
            have the language and API version build into their name too, so that they do not clash.
            In most cases a simple name of the form, "MyAddIn.MyCommandName", will suffice.

            A 'button' element can also have a 'label' attribute instead of a 'command' attribute.
            This could be used as a placeholder before a Command object has been created.  Note that
            the image can only be specified if you use the 'command' attribute.  The Image property 
            of the Command object is used.
